  <br/>
  by Tongyu Zhou, Haoyu Sheng, Iris Howley</p><div class="idyll-step "><p>
  Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) is an AI algorithm
  used in intelligent tutoring systems to model a learner’s
  mastery of the skill being taught. <br/></p><p>Let us first consider this algorithm
  (BKT) in the context of an “alchemy” metaphor. Think of the large beaker
  as representative of the overall mastery of the student for the one skill of interest.
  The test tubes are representative of the factors that go into
  calculating mastery.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
  These factors are called <em>parameters</em>. BKT uses a total of 4
  different parameters. From left to right, they are:<br/>1) <strong>init</strong> : probability of learner knowing the skill beforehand <br/>2) <strong>transit</strong> : probability of learner learning the skill after application<br/>3) <strong>slip</strong> : probability of learner messing up when using a known skill<br/>4) <strong>guess</strong> : probability of learner has a lucky guess<br/></p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    The weights these parameters carry in the equation are determined by
    the person applying the algorithm.<br/><br/>
    As we are dealing with probabilities, this person can set each parameter
    value as anything from 0 to 1. While this is the theoretical setup,
    these parameter values in practice are usually bounded by more
    restrictive ranges. <br/></p><p>That is, a common model is to set <em>P(slip)</em> &lt;= 0.1
    and <em>P(guess)</em> &lt;= 0.3 to make the mastery predictions more realistic. What this
    does, mathematically, is to minimize the sum-of-squares residual.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
  Before taking the actual evaluation (or after pre-test), the probability
  of a student mastering the skill is equal to the <em>init</em> probability:<br/><img src="static/images/eq1.png" width="150px" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>
  In other words, the greater the <em>init</em> value is, the higher the level of mastery
  is before any questions are even answered.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
  The algorithm relies on something called “conditional probability.” That is,
  depending on whether a learner answers a current question correctly or incorrectly,
  the formulas we use to calculate their mastery for that state will be different!<br/><br/>
  Correct answer: <br/><img src="static/images/eq2correct.png" width="420px" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>
   Incorrect answer: <br/><img src="static/images/eq2wrong.png" width="420px" idyll="[object Object]"/></p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
  Continuing with the notion of “conditional probability,” the mastery of a current
  state also depends on the mastery of a previous state. <br/></p><p>This is a “Markov chain”, so the mastery of the most recent state is both
  dependent on the previous immediate state (more significantly) and the
  first state (less significantly). <br/></p><p>Note that this means even, when a learner gets everything wrong, the mastery still
  increases, albeit by a little bit.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "> The learner continues to answer questions...   </div><div class="idyll-step "><p> Until they have achieved at least 95% mastery. Note that
  this is the only requirement--it does not matter how many questions they
  have answered thus far or how many correct streaks they have. Now, the
  skill is mastered!</p><p>Congrats on finishing the explainable!<br/><a url="https://some.url" href="https://some.url">Click here</a> to continue on to the next step</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
